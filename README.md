# Homework collection of Biostatistical Methods 2 (P8131)

## Course Description
Regression analysis is widely used in biomedical research. Non-continuous (e.g., binary or count-valued) responses, correlated observations, and censored data are frequently encountered in regression analysis. This course will introduce advanced statistical methods to address these practical problems. 

Topics include generalized linear models (GLM) for non-Gaussian response, mixed-effects models and generalized estimating equations (GEE) for correlated observations, and Cox proportional hazards models for survival data analysis. Examples are drawn from biomedical sciences.

Homework examples are drawn from healthcare field dataset.
